#this program is intended to take unshifted files from the HexSieve progam, and shift them so that they are consistant
#with previous files.
#NOTE:::: Once this is implelemented on the NUCAR Server, oldPath, slashVar, and newPath must be changed. Their values
#for the server system are currently commented out near the top of the script.
#Also the program might need to be adjusted for whatever 00000 buffering occurs from HexSieve, and whatever is desiered.
